# rust-lock-bug-detector
Statically detect double-lock &amp; conflicting-lock bugs on MIR.

This work follows up the our elaborated Rust study in [Understanding Memory and Thread Safety Practices and Issues in Real-World Rust Programs](https://songlh.github.io/paper/rust-study.pdf) in PLDI'20.
I am honored to share the co-first author with Yilun Chen and be able to collaborate with far-sighted, knowledgeable and hardworking Prof Linhai Song and Yiying Zhang. 
I focus on Rust unsafe code and concurrency bugs in this paper.
This project is my initial efforts to improve the concurrency safety in Rust ecosystem by statically detecting two common kinds of concurrency bugs: 
double lock and locks in conflicting order.
